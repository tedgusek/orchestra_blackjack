# orchestra_blackjack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

For best results, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

When runnning in dev mode, there's the double render in strict mode, so building the app, and running that will be a smoother User experience
